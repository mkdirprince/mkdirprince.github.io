            <summary>What did I do?</summary>
            <p>
                I mistakenly sent a message in the announcement-project Slack channel,
                which is strictly reserved for mentors to share task updates and stage assignments.
            </p>

            <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
            <p>
                HNG operates based on structured task completion. The announcement-project channel 
                serves as a dedicated space for assignment communications. Messages from interns 
                can clutter the channel, making it harder for others to locate important updates.

            <p>
                I will carefully review my messages before sending and ensure 
                they are directed to the appropriate channel or recipient.
